v0.1.1			23/03/2024			Just a simple block of code and trying if spaCy and python works.
v0.1.2			23/03/2024			Started an idea about how should T.R.I.M.S work.
v0.1.3			23/03/2024			T.R.I.M.S found all files in the same directory as the code and it should have written them out (there were 0 files).
v0.1.4			23/03/2024			T.R.I.M.S tried finding all files in C:\\ and wrote out all filenames.
v0.1.5			23/03/2024			Since T.R.I.M.S wrote out all the files it found (nearly 400000), I saw just how many of these files even exist in this computer.
v0.1.6			23/03/2024			First stable version. T.R.I.M.S didn't write out all files and just showed the amount of these files.

v0.2			23/03/2024			Improving the file searching capabilities. 
v0.2.1			23/03/2024			Reducing the number of files showing in T.R.I.M.S. Reducing by hidden files, directories (folders like "windows", "program files", "program files (x86)", "programdata") and system file types (removing "dll", "sys" and "exe" files) . Amount of files got from 400000 to nearly 76000 files.

v0.3			24/03/2024			T.R.I.M.S asks user to write the directory to search from and gives user the amount of files it found. Then T.R.I.M.S asks if user wants it to write out all files in a separate text file.
v0.3.1			24/03/2024			T.R.I.M.S found this time only 1200 files and it's a big improvement. Added .exe files to the search management (now it can show .exe files). Removed Appdata folder from search (it won't show it anymore).
v0.3.2			24/03/2024			Reduced files a little by removing .ini files (system files). Keep in mind to empty recycle bin in a while.
v0.3.3			24/03/2024			Tried to reduce by removing whole default folder, but it went wrong. (Unstable).
v0.3.4			24/03/2024			Fixed some problems with v0.3.3. (Stable version and file amount reduced to 700).
v0.3.5			24/03/2024			Removed Searches folder.

v0.4			24/03/2024			Removed .igpi and .dat file types. Management is done and is next stable version.
v0.4.1			24/03/2024			Tried to remove a specific file (ntuser.dat) from showing up, but it didn't work. 
v0.4.2			24/03/2024			Tried to fix it again, but now it just quits the program after choosing directory. (Very unstable).
v0.4.3			24/03/2024			It is now stable again, but it still won't exclude ntusar.dat.
v0.4.4			24/03/2024			I finally fixed it. Now it doesn't include ntusar.dat file in the file list. (Stable again)
v0.4.5			24/03/2024			Implementing send2trash library to ensure that files in the recycle bin won't show up in file list. T.R.I.M.S quits again when choosing directory.
v0.4.6			24/03/2024			Since send2trash didn't work, I tried to implement ctypes and try do exclude the path manually. It still didn't work.
v0.4.7			24/03/2024			I considered that I should try to exclude Recycle bin later because it has been so much pain in the ass. (Almost the same version as v0.4.4, just with some minor adjustments).
v0.4.8			24/03/2024			Removed prompt to ask directory. Implemented default_directory (C:\\).

v0.5			25/03/2024			Implementing a new file management update. Not fully working yet.
v0.5.1			25/03/2024			T.R.I.M.S sorted files by file type in output file, but in command it showed wrong status.
v0.5.2			25/03/2024			Fixed T.R.I.M.S showing wrong status, but needs some graphic adjustments.
v0.5.3			25/03/2024			Fixed T.R.I.M.S creating automatically output file. (Now user can choose the name for output file).
v0.5.4			25/03/2024			Some little bugfixes of text showing twice etc.
v0.5.5			25/03/2024			Cleaning procedures. Objective keep windows, appdata and programdata as only folders that aren't allowed and sort more through file types. (Files found: 70000)

v0.6			26/03/2024			Update v0.6. These folders are disabled: (windows, programdata, appdata, program files, program files (x86)) and these file types: (.dll, .sys, .ini, .igpi, .tmp, .cat, .cur, .ino, .xml, .lnk, .cpp, .h, .dat, .ani, .inf, .dat). (Discontinued!)
v0.6.1			26/03/2024			Code cleaning and debugging.

v0.7			26/03/2024			Integrating NLP with spaCy. First tests.
v0.7.1			26/03/2024			Implementing a prompt where T.R.I.M.S asks user if he wants to make an output file or not.
v0.7.2			26/03/2024			Quick bugfixes and code organization.
v0.7.3			26/03/2024			Fixed not showing welcome message.
v0.7.4			26/03/2024			Cannot install en-core-web-trf. Uninstalled en-core-web-sm. Gives errors.

v0.8			27/03/2024			Installed en_core_web_trf and now it recognizes a sentence about searching for files.
v0.8.1			29/03/2024			Implemented built-in timeit module to measure time of execution.
v0.8.2			29/03/2024			Integrated a command to exit the program. 
v0.8.3			29/03/2024			Simple bugfixes and code organizing. Fixed T.R.I.M.S to load in too slow (13 seconds) (new loading time: 6 seconds).

v0.9			29/03/2024			Fixed T.R.I.M.S exiting after being told to not make an output file.
